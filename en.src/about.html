    <p>The majority of internationally-bound traffic in countries that filter
    content requests are routed through a fixed number of centralized
    exchanges where surveillance and censorship technology is installed.
    Traditional circumvention technologies require the user to connect
    directly to a proxy in the uncensored zone. This design gives the
    censor an advantage in locating and blocking popular proxies, VPN
    servers, relays, bridges, etc.</p>

    <p>CENO proposes a fundamentally different solution: reduce the requests to externally available proxy
    servers and enable the storage of retrieved content inside the censored
    zone. CENOs advantage comes from being both a transport and a storage
    solution.</p>

<!--p style="text-align:center"><img src="img/ceno_infographic.png" width="75%" alt="CENO2 infographic"></p>-->

    <p>Peer-to-peer routing is the ideal solution for the “cat and mouse” scenario that most circumvention providers end up playing with
    the censor. Clients need not know the location of a proxy to relay
    censored content, instead using small-world networks to connect to
    their peers, and thereafter to a bridge in the uncensored zone.</p>

    <p>Once a website is accessed by a single user (node), it is stored and
    continues to propagate inside the country peer-to-peer.  Individual
    nodes are referenced by an identifier which does not give away their
    physical location.  Content remains available inside the censored zone
    even if external connectivity is cut. Content can be seeded into the
    network via alternative means as well (e.g. uploaded from a USB drive).</p>
